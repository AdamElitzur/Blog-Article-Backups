Last week, I had the incredible opportunity to attend the Congressional App Challenge #HouseOfCode event in Washington, D.C. This was the pinnacle of my experience with the Congressional App Challenge, where winning students from across the country had the opportunity to showcase their apps to Congress at the U.S. Capitol building.

## Songlingo background

A few months ago, I started building [Songlingo](https://song-lingo.com), a website to help people learn languages through songs. You can read more about how I built it [here](https://blog.adamelitzur.com/6-weeks-of-building-my-dream-with-buildspace-nights-weekends). I submitted the website to the Congressional App Challenge in my district, and it ended up [winning](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/23-FL25/), out of 50+ other projects.

## Day 1

#HouseOfCode started with registration, in the Capitol Visitor Center Atrium, where I picked up my badge and t-shirt. After that, I explored the STEM Inspiration Fair, where I got to talk to representatives from organizations like MIT App Inventor, SMASH Academy, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. It was great to learn about all the different pathways into STEM fields.

The rest of the first day was packed with engaging panel discussions and workshops. I really enjoyed the "Launching into the Future" panel, where entrepreneurs from Amazon Web Services, theCoderSchool, US Patent and Trademark Office, and Duke shared their stories of building impactful STEM-based businesses. And in the "Digital Trail" fireside chat, I learned a lot about protecting my online privacy and managing my digital footprint.

## Day 2

The second day featured student app demonstrations! As part of the Eastern Cohort, I had an hour in the morning to set up my station and get ready to showcase my website, Songlingo. When the doors opened, it was amazing to see Members of Congress, tech leaders, and other attendees checking out all the incredible student projects. I pitched Songlingo to many attendees, handing out business cards, which received a great response. I even got a visit from Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who tried out the app herself, with the song Keep on Loving You, by REO Speedwagon! She is learning Spanish, and mentioned that she is excited to add Songlingo to her study routine.

I then had the opportunity to try new smart glasses from App Challenge sponsors, Meta and Snap Inc. Meta’s includes AI functionality, bringing the power of large language models to wearable technology. Snap Inc.’s is more focused on augmented reality.

Then, my Congresswoman’s office gave me a tour of the Capitol. I got to see the old and new locations of the Senate and House of Representatives, as well as the beautiful art in the building. The Capitol Rotunda was quite impressive, with its historically significant paintings and sculptures.

After the demos, it was the Eastern Cohort's turn for the Congressional Keynote session. We heard from representatives like Jen Kiggans, Ted Lieu, Deborah Ross, Zach Nunn, and Becca Balint, as well as Dr. Darin Gray (USC), Jasson Crockett (Snap, Inc), Hansel Lynn (theCoderSchool), Anjali Bhatia (CollegeWise), Sabrina Roshan (RISE), and Victor Foulk (CGI). These speakers discussed the importance of the Congressional App Challenge and the future of STEM education. It was truly inspiring to be in that room, surrounded by so many supportive leaders. We then had a group picture, with the entire Eastern cohort!

I then had the opportunity to view the Western Cohort’s demonstrations. It was inspiring to see what my peers created, and their impact on solving a myriad of problems.

## Advice and Reflections

Overall, my experience at the #HouseOfCode event was unforgettable. I got to showcase my work, network with passionate STEM professionals, and meet amazing student innovators from across the country. It was an honor to represent Florida’s 25th district at the Capitol. I can't wait to see what the future holds!

Next year, I am considering applying to the Congressional App Challenge Alumni Advisory Board, and hopefully have the opportunity to help plan next year’s #HouseOfCode for all of the future winners!
